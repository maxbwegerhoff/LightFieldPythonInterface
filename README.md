# LightFieldPythonInterface

## Step 1: Create an experiment in Lightfield with your desired settings

Example: I created an experiment called "HRS500_Pixis100_test". Such an experiment must exist for the interface to work. In this experiment one can adjust all the settings as needed beforehand.

However, for the interface to work correctly one must use the following settings in the Export Data tab:

and in the save data file tab:

Everything else is handled by the python class. For a demo of the class have a look in demo_lfautom.py
